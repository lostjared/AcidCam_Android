# AcidCam Android


Going to work on this project again and see if I can make some progress.

Now asks for permission to use the Camera / File System.

Also, you will need to add the program to the list of exempted apps from the Battery saver
in the exempted apps. Otherwise, the battery saver app will kill the program if it thinks it is
using to much battery power.

Also, it only works in Landscape mode; you may have to use the Flip X, Flip Y, or Flip X and Y
on your tablet because they are all different.

Most of these issues will hopefully be worked through as
the project is still in early development, so it is not perfect or 100% yet.

You can find the C++ code for the Acid Cam filters here: https://github.com/lostjared/libacidcam
